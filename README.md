## Home Manager
Use this as a Snips skill/ action to control the lights and TV.

Makes use of 2 'modes', command mode and conversation mode. Whilst in command mode one line commands can be made e.g. "hey snips, turn the bedroom light off". The conversation mode is triggered using intents like "hey snips, im home" or "hey snips, im leaving". Whilst in this mode Snips will ask a series of questions to manage the state of the home e.g. lights on? how bright? what color? tv on? It will then carry out the requests.
